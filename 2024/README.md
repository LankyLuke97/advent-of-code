# Advent of Code 2024
It's that time of year again, where we crank out solutions to bizarre puzzles and hope that it shows some level of improvement on the year before. This year, I'll be writing solutions in Python and, initially, Elixir; these were chosen because I'm trying to get actually really good with a language, to a point where I can comfortably claim to be competent in it (Fluent Python for the win) and, in the other case, because I had some vague idea that revisiting a functional language would be good for me, much like going to Church; in both cases, I gave up quickly, though I think the purveyors of functional languages may be more persistent in hunting me down than the denizens of hell. I will likely revisit these problems in Elixir next year, but I will need time to actually learn the basic syntax of the language and patterns of usage.  

I also wanted to write the post-mortem as I went along - alas, this has not happened. As with the best of them, I have decided to blunder on and write it up as quickly as I can regardless. Find below the links to the various days, and enjoy.
